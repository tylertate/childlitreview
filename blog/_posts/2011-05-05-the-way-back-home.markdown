What do you do if the airplane you're piloting suddenly runs out of fuel? The little boy in *The Way Back Home,* has only one choice: a crash landing on the moon.

But boy's aren't the only creatures who take refuge on the moon. Soon, a martian in a spaceship comes in for a crash landing of his own. Though frightened by one another at first, the boy and martian team up to help fix one another's vehicles, with the boy parachuting down to earth to pickup a few tools (and being hoisted back up with a rope).

While the story itself is engaging enough, the words are subservient to Oliver Jeffers's incredibly rich, expressive illustrations. Jeffers's unique style — sitting somewhere between hand-drawn artwork and graphic design — is bold, extremely witty, and will make any art school graduate envious.

There are good lessons learned in this story as well, from helping others to persevering through difficulty.

Every boy should have a copy of *The Way Back Home.*
