title: Why Developers Should Become UX Designers
---

**Why do you code?** It's probably not just for a pay check (lets face it, there are plenty of boring jobs out there that pay the bills). [Maybe](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html "A Field Guide to Developers by Joel Spolsky") you code because you like working with the latest technology, or perhaps you take pleasure in crafting concise, elegant solutions to tough problems.

Did I hear you say, "I code to deliver value to users"? Hmm, didn't think so. But you're not alone: [designers](http://www.petervcook.com/leading-creatives/5-love-languages-of-creatives/ "The 5 Love Languages of Creatives by Peter V. Cook") have their own set of motivations devoid of the user, from seeking the praise of others to creating a work of art.

It's imperative that both designers and developers fight against our natural inclinations and treat the user as king. Whatever you're working on, whether it's an API for a payment gateway or a new request handler for Solr, you're building it for the people who will use it. Want to become a better developer? Then start designing the user experience.
