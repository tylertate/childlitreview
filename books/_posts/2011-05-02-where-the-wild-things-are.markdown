"That very night in Max's room a forest grew, and grew, and grew..." Suddenly Max was no longer in his own room, but found himself sailing across the world to the place where the wild things are. Upon his arrival, the wild things hail Max as their king. They share many adventures together until, eventually, Max begins to feel lonely. Despite the wild things begging him to stay, Max sets back off around the world to be where he was loved.

*Where The Wild Things Are* is a dream-like tale of a child's unique ability to alter his surroundings and write himself into his own story. The text flows, though it doesn't rhyme, and the illustrations are ethereal, imaginative, and skilfully executed.

The reading breezes by in just over three minutes. It's brevity and immersive visuals mean that my son, Galileo, at just 15 months old, regularly pulls this book off the shelf during our reading time.

There are two words of caution with this book. First, the wild things with their horns, claws, and sharp teeth do look scary, and I could see them frightening some children. Secondly, at the beginning of the book Max talks back to his mother, saying "I'll eat you up" as he pretends to be one of the wild things. This results in Max being sent to his room, setting the stage for his imaginary adventure. Some parents may prefer not to provide this example of misbehavior to their children, despite the corresponding punishment.

In the end it's a beautiful story with art direction that is second to none. If only it weren't quite so scary and wasn't based on a premise of misbehavior.
