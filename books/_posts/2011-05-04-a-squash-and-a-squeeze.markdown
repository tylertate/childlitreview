Set on a farm in the countryside, the story begins with a little old lady feeling sorry for herself because of the small house in which she lives. A wise old man overhears her complaining and suggests a remedy: "Take in your hen." The little old lady finds this to be strange advice, but she consents, only to find that her house feels more crowded, not less. She returns to the wise old man to petition his counsel once more. The wise old man instructs her to take in her goat, and then her pig, and then her cow. The little old lady, squashed into a house full of farm animals, is at her wits end when the wise old man finally advises her to kick all of the animals back out of the house. The little old lady, to her surprise, discovers that her house is really quite spacious after all.

This lesson in contentment is told with humour and delight, complemented by expressive illustrations. The sing-song, repetitive rhyme has captured my son Galileo's attention since well before he was a year old. Written and illustrated by the same talented team behind *The Gruffalo,* *A Squash and a Squeeze* is actually my favorite of Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler's books. I highly recommend it.
